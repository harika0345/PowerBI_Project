# 📊 Global Socio-Economic and Education Insights using Power BI & Python

## 🌍 Project Overview
This project combines **Python-based preprocessing** with **Power BI dashboards** to analyze and visualize global socio-economic and educational indicators.  
The aim is to understand how factors like **GDP, unemployment, government expenditure, and life expectancy** impact **education enrollment rates** across countries.

## 📂 Project Components
1. **Python Preprocessing (notebooks/Powerbi_ProjectFile.ipynb)**  
   - Loads data from public datasets.  
   - Cleans and integrates multiple sources:
     - GDP and socio-economic indicators
     - Education enrollment ratios (Primary, Secondary, Tertiary)
     - Population & life expectancy  
   - Prepares data for visualization.

2. **Power BI Dashboard (reports/Powerbi_screenshot.pbix)**  
   - Visualizes the relationship between **GDP and education expenditure**.  
   - Shows enrollment ratios across countries.  
   - Explores how socio-economic factors affect education levels and life expectancy.  
   - Provides insights for **policy-making, research, and development analysis**.
